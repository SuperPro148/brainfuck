A simple Brainfuck interpreter that probably has lots of bugs that will not be solved.

Includes:
1. Interpreter script + cmd file (run from command line: bf filename.extension)
2. Minifier script + cmd file (run from command line: min-bf filename.extension)
3. START cmd file, run this to be able to use this everywhere on your computer

The minifier removes all comments and whitespace from your code and outputs the minified code into a new file named: min-filename.extension
